## 1.1.1 Bonds and the Continuous Compounding of Interest Rates

 * A bond is a long-term loan contract between two parties,
 * issuer(발행사) and the holder(보유자)
 * borrower or debtor, lender
 * principal(원금)
 * coupon (이자표) : the successive interest payments
 * maturity date (만기일)
 
 
### Compounding the interest

* Compouding the interest (복리)
 -  We should all be aware that most of all risk–free securities that earn interest at a certain fixed rate have their value computed through time by compounding the interest.
 - This means that the interest earned at a certain moment is added to the current value of the investment and the next interest is computed over the resulting sum.
 - Therefore the value of the security with interest depends not only on the interest rate, but also on the frequency in which the interest is compounded.

### Payoff and profit of bonds
 
  * payoff
   - The payoff of any security is its value at maturity. For a bond, its payoff is the principal plus all interests paid on the principal, and given by Eq.(1.2), or if continuously compounding of interest is assumed it is given by Eq.(1.3).
  * profit 
   - The profit of a security is its risk-adjusted payoff discounting the initial investment, which includes contract fees or any other transaction costs.
   - For bonds there are usually no transactions costs or fees (or if there were, we can assume them to be included in the principal), and the risk is null.
   - hence, the profit given by a bond is obtained by discounting the principal to the payoff

### Reading a stock quotes table

 <img src="figure/fig1.2.png" style="width: 80%;"/>
 
 * Ticker : the company’s id for the market (e.g. for General Electric Co. is GE).
 * Open : the price of the stock at the opening time of the market session
 * Close : the price of the stock at the current time, if the market is in session, or the
 * High : (or Max) is the maximum price reached by the stock between the Open and the Close price.
 * Low : (or Min) is the minimum price reached by the stock between the Open and the Close price.
 * Volume : is the number of shares traded between the times of Open and Close.
 * Adjusted Close : is the closing price adjusted to include any dividend payments plus any other corporate actions that affect the stock price (e.g. splits and rights
offerings).

### R Example 1.1

```{r}
#install.packages("quantmod")
library(quantmod)

# retrieve historical price data for General Electric Co. from Yahoo Finance
getSymbols('GE',src='yahoo', from="2000-01-01", to="2009-12-30")
# to see headers of file (OHLCV type)
names(GE)
head(GE)
# extract Adjusted Close
geAdj = GE$GE.Adjusted["2000-01-01/2000-01-20"]
head(geAdj)
# compute max, min and mean
max(geAdj); min(geAdj); mean(geAdj)
# draw a chart
chartSeries(GE)
```

### Stock indices

 * Price weighted
 * Capitalization-weighted


### Example 1.2 (A price weighted index)

The Dow Jones Industrial Average, conceived by Charles Dow and Edward Jones (1896), is computed by the following formula

### Example 1.3 (A capitalization weighted index)

The Madrid Stock Exchange principal index, IBEX35, is computed by the following formula

### Example 1.4 (Value Line Stock Index)

One of the most reputed market index, used as benchmark for American and Canadian stock markets, is the Value Line Index. This is a composite index of about 1,700 companies from the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ, AMEX, and the Toronto Stock Exchange. Originally launched in 1961, it is calculated as an equally weighted geometric average, the index VLIC. Then in 1988, an arithmetic average version for the same composition of stocks, the VLIA, was released. The formula for calculating the Value Line Geometric Index (VLIC) is

<img src="figure/eq1.10.png" style="width: 80%;"/>

where VLIC_t stands for the value of the index at time t, C_i,_t is the current (or Close) price of stock i at time t , and n is the number of stocks. For the Value Line Arithmetic Index (VLIA), the formula with similar nomenclature is given by
